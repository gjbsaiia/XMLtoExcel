# XMLtoExcel
###was given the lame project of sending out surveys - so obviously I came up with an over engineered solution</br>
</br>
Used Microsoft InfoPath to make three surveys, set each survey to email me the response, set rule in Outlook to save attachment</br>
to specified "raw_data" folder and delete email, and then wrote this python script to auto enter the XML data into the excel sheet.</br>
The python is a bit more hardcoded than I'd like, but it works! Hopefully someone on here can scavenge some reusable parts.
